<iox_node>
- A node represents all, or a subset of, a physical device such as lamp, switch, keypad, smoke detector, etc., or a conceptual device such as weather information or even stock quotes.

- A node definition is used to describe a node. It contains the list of properties it maintains (e.g. the current temperature, heat/cool setpoints for a thermostat), the list of commands it accepts (e.g. on/off for a dimmer lamp), and a list of the commands it may send out (e.g. on/off for a dimmer switch).

- A node has the following attributes:
nodedefId: The nodedef used by this node
address: A string that uniquely identifies the node. lets call this @TYPE_NODEADDR.
name:  The human readable name of the name

<example>
<nodeInfo>
    <node nodeDefId="ZB45186_011_1">
        <address>ZB45186_011_1</address>
        <name>Hue Living Room</name>
    </node>
</nodeInfo>
</example>

== IoX Node Property Events ==
- A node property event is sent out whenever a node property changes
- The event is sent in the form of an XML message with the following tags
<Event>:
 - Indicates its an IoX Event message

<control>:
 - The data contains the @TYPE_IOX_PROPERTY_ID of the property that changed

<action uom="@TYPE_UOM" prec="@TYPE_PREC">@TYPE_FIXED_PRECISION_INTEGER</action>:
  - The xml data is the value of the property

<node>@TYPE_NODEADDR</node>:
  - The address of the node owning the property

<fmtAct>:
  - The formatted value

e.g. Property "ST" for Node "D 51 25 1" changed to 75%
<Event seqnum="50" sid="uuid:31" timestamp="2025-02-18T12:16:35.924158-08:00">
   <control>ST</control>
   <action uom="51" prec="0">75</action>
   <node>ZY005_1</node>
   <eventInfo />
   <fmtAct>75%</fmtAct>
</Event>
