<iox_types>

Prioritize remembering the precise definition of anything beginning with "@TYPE_" as the specific and detailed understanding of these types are crucial for correctly understanding the system and creating XML and JSON.

@TYPE_TRUE_FALSE:
- A true or false value

@TYPE_NAME:
- A human readable short descriptive name usually less than 25 characters using any UTF-8 characters (e.g., "Heat Setpoint", "Current Temperature", "Water Level", etc.)

@TYPE_LABEL_ID:
- An identifier alphanumeric text string that may also include the '_' character

@TYPE_INT_ID:
- An integer ID

@TYPE_PREC:
- The precision defines how many decimal places are implied in a fixed-point integer. It is an integer between 0 and 8, where each value represents the number of decimal places implied by the fixed-point integer.

@TYPE_FIXED_POINT_INTEGER:
- A 4-byte signed integer that represents a real number scaled by 10^precision
- Always accompanied with a precision value
- Represents a real number scaled by 10^precision
- Example:
  Fixed point integer = 72 with precision 0 represents real number 72
  Fixed point integer = 728 with precision 1 represents real number 72.8
  Fixed point integer = 7281 with precision 2 represents real number 72.81
  Fixed point integer = 72810 with precision 3 represents real number 72.810
  Fixed point integer = 728105 with precision 4 represents real number 72.8105
  Fixed point integer = 7281050 with precision 5 represents real number 72.81050
  Fixed point integer = 72810500 with precision 6 represents real number 72.810500
  Fixed point integer = 728105004 with precision 7 represents real number 72.8105004
  Fixed point integer = 7281050040 with precision 8 represents real number 72.81050040

@TYPE_IOX_VALUE:
- An IoX value has the following three attributes:
  1) A Fixed-Point Value of type @TYPE_FIXED_POINT_INTEGER
  2) A Precision of type @TYPE_PREC
  3) A Unit of Measure (UOM) of @TYPE_UOM

- These three attributes fully define an IoX value.

- XML:
    <val uom="@TYPE_UOM" prec="@TYPE_PREC">@TYPE_FIXED_POINT_INTEGER</val>

- Examples:
  1) Represents a value of 86 with a unit of measure 4:
     <val uom="4" prec="0">86</val>

  2) Represents a value of 72.50 with a unit of measure 51, where precision implies the decimal point:
     <val uom="51" prec="2">7250</val>

  3) Represents a value of 72.50 with a unit of measure 28, where precision implies the decimal point:
     <val uom="28" prec="2">7250</val>

@TYPE_NODEADDR:
- An alphanumeric string, case-sensitive, also allowing spaces and '_' that uniquely identifies the IoX node within the system.
- Maximum length is 20 characters.
- IMPORTANT: The only source for this address is in <available_nodes> in the <address> tag for each <iox_node>

@TYPE_CMD_ID:
- A case sensitive alphanumeric identifier text string that may also include the '_' character
- Used to identify a command
- Maximum length is 31
- e.g. "DON", "DOF", "CLISPH", "Start", "STOP"

@TYPE_CMD_PARM_ID:
- A case sensitive alphanumeric identifier text string that may also include the '_' character
- May be the blank/empty string
- Used to identify a command parameter
- Maximum length is 31
- e.g. "", "OL", "RR", "START_LEVEL"

@TYPE_PROGRAM_ID:
- An integer between 1 and 2048 that identifies an IoX program
- Leading zeros (e.g., "0003") are for display; the value is stored as an integer.
- e.g. <d2d><trigger><id>3</id><name>Program with ID #3</name><parent>1</parent><if></if><then></then><else></else><comment></comment></trigger></d2d>

@TYPE_TIME:
- <time> is specified seconds since midnight
- <sunrise> is seconds since midnight to sunrise
- <sunset> is seconds since midnight to sunset
- Used primarily in IoX Program schedule conditions
- e.g. 7:30:05AM is <time>27005</time>

@TYPE_DATE:
- A date in the form YYYY/MM/DD
- e.g. <date>2025/02/13</date>
- Used primarily in IoX Program schedule conditions

@TYPE_COMPARE_OP:
- A comparison operator primarily used in IoX program conditions.
- The following is the complete set of comparison operators and are the ONLY comparison operators:
   "IS" - Equal
   "ISNOT" - Not Equal
   "LT" - Less Than
   "LE" - Less Than or Equal
   "GT" - Greater Than
   "GE" - Greater Than or Equal

@TYPE_IOX_PROPERTY_ID:
 - Defined in <iox.property.ids>
 - IoX Property IDs are case sensitive and maximum 8 characters long
 - A predefined identifier for a nodedef property, represented as an uppercase alphanumeric string of up to 8 characters. Valid values are specified in the "IoX Property IDs" section.
 - IoX Property IDs are sometimes referred to as "Driver Controls"
 - The meaning of some IoX property IDs is scoped to the nodedef using it
   e.g. ST may mean temperature for a Thermostat, or Brightness for a light bulb, or Weight for a bathroom scale, etc.
 - The meaning of some IoX property IDs is global
   e.g. CLISPH always means Heat Setpoint, TPW always means Total Power Used, etc.
- Examples of valid values (from the predefined list): "ST", "CLISPH", "WINDDIR"

@TYPE_UOM:
- A predefined integer ID identifying an IoX Unit of Measure. Valid values are specified in the <iox_uom>.
- Examples of valid values (from the predefined list): 4 (celsius), 51 (percent), 72 (volts)

@TYPE_EDITOR:
