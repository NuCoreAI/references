<iox_profile>
- A complete set of nodedefs and editors is called a profile
- A family is a product family such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, Insteon, and others.
- A family has an integer ID, we will call it @TYPE_FAMILY
- An Instance is an instance of a family (e.g. a specific Z-Wave network)
- An instance has an integer ID, we will call it @TYPE_FAMILY_INSTANCE
- All profiles belong to (and are thus scoped to) an instance of family

- JSON for profiles (with comments using C++ syntax)
