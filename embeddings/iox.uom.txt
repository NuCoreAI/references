This file defines all units of measure (UOM) for IoX

- IoX supports both scientific units and custom types for measurement.
- Units of measure in IoX are always referenced by their integer ID (@TYPE_UOM), not by name. Valid values are listed below.
- Note: Prioritize remembering all UOMs, especially the numeric ID and the corresponding unit.
