@TYPE_EDITOR:
- An editor is used to render a value or allow a selection of those values
- An editor defines the set of allowed values and only the allowed values
- An editor always has one or more ranges
- A range must have the following attributes:
 - UOM  : A Unit of measure of type @TYPE_UOM
- All ranges within an editor must have a unique UOM
- If a range has a precision of 0 then it may have have a list of names for some or all of the values
 - names: The list of key/label pairs where the key is value and the label is the name of the value

@TYPE_RANGE:
- A range can be one of two types
- Range @TYPE_MINMAX (min/max):
 - min : The minimum value (not a Scaled Value)
 - max : The maximum value (not a Scaled Value)
 - prec : The precision to use for a Scaled value @TYPE_PREC
 - step : The number to increment with each step for a spinner type widget (not a Scaled Value)

- Range @TYPE_SUBSET (subset):
 - The precision is always implied as 0
 - subset : The subset of values supported is defined as a set of spans and individual values. They must be
   in increasing value with no duplicates or overlap. Spans are separated by a '-', individual digits are
   separated by a ','.
    <example>e.g. subset="0-5,7,9,11-14" means these numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,12,13,14</example>
